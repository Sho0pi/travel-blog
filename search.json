[{"categories":["Travel Stories"],"content":"Me and my girlfriend spent about 4 days in Okinawa as a quick getaway trip. During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called Kumejima (久米島町) - just a 30-minute flight (or a 4-hour boat ride) from the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but honestly, it was the best decision we made on this whole trip! Our tiny 40-seater airplane We landed in Kumejima pretty early, around 11AM, and had a few hours to kill before hotel check-in - and to be honest, we really didn’t know what to expect. We brought our snorkel masks from home and just hoped for the best. According to the internet, there are only two bus lines on the island… We only saw one — and it comes every two hours. There were also just two taxis waiting at the airport. Hahaha. When we arrived, we thought: maybe we should try to hitchhike? I’ve done it a few times before (like here) and my girlfriend really wanted to give it a try. And let me tell you - it was a great success. In just 30 hours, we managed to hitchhike with 6 different people! First hitchhike - with a marine biologist who was on our flight Snorkeling in Paradise We only had 30 hours on this island, so we ended up going to just 3–4 beaches! The first beach we went to was Eef Beach. This place seriously looked like paradise — 50 shades of blue in the water, pretty clean visibility, and an amazing view all the way to the horizon. It was only a 2-minute walk from our hotel, so it made the perfect first stop before we could check in. We literally hid our bags and changed into swimsuits in the middle of the road. The beach itself was great. There’s even a Family Mart within walking distance, so we grabbed some snacks and beers. We tried snorkeling there, but because it was a windy day, the water near the shore got pretty sandy — not the greatest experience. After talking to some locals, we realized this is actually one of the least recommended places to snorkel in Kume… We still saw a bunch of fish, but it was nothing compared to what came next. Since check-in time still hadn’t arrived, I was like, “Let’s just walk a bit and maybe hitchhike our way to the east side of the island.” There are two tiny islands connected to the main one by a bridge, and I thought they might be a cool place to snorkel. Little did I know we’d end up hitchhiking with this super friendly and kind local named Kairi (you’ll hear more about him later). He picked us up, showed us around a bit, and then drove us all the way to this spot at the edge of the second island. He told us this was the perfect time to see sea turtles. We were so excited. Even though low tide was starting to kick in, we grabbed our gear and ran straight into the water. The water was super shallow - maybe 1 meter deep at most. We saw three white murenas swimming around, switching their little “camping spots” and hunting small fish. Then, just as the sun hit the water at the right angle, we started spotting them - sea turtles! So many of them, just casually swimming in the shallow water, munching on sea grass. We spent the next two hours walking around in the water, trying to get close to the turtles without scaring them off. But every time they noticed us, they zoomed away - I had no idea turtles could swim that fast. The beach across the road from our hotel After that, we were completely dead. We hitchhiked back with a Japanese guy who didn’t know a single word of English, but he somehow dropped us off exactly at our hotel. Called it a day. Well… kind of. Later that night we woke up starving - but turns out almost everything on the island closes ridiculously early. I’m talking 7PM and you’re out of luck. Thank god for Family Mart again. We grabbed whatever snacks we could find, and then remembered: Kairi, the guy who gave us a ride earlier, had told us he owns one of the only bars in Kume, so we decided to check it out. We headed over and ended up spending the night hanging out with him and his local basketball team - just drinking, chatti","date":"2025-07-04","objectID":"/stories/japan/30-hours-in-kumejima/:0:0","tags":["Japan","Okinawa","Island Adventure","Hitchhiking","Snorkeling"],"title":"30 Hours in Kumejima - the Best Island in Japan","uri":"/stories/japan/30-hours-in-kumejima/"},{"categories":null,"content":"I’ve stayed for 3 weeks in the begginging of 2024 in this magical island in the south of Thailand.
