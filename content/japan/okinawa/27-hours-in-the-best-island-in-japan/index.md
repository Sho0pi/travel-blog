Me and my girlfriend spent about 4 days in Okinawa as a quick getaway trip.
During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called
Kumejima (久米島町), located just a 30-minute flight - or a 4-hour boat ride
from the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but it was the best decision
we made on this whole trip!
