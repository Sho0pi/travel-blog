Me and my girlfriend spent about 4 days in Okinawa as a quick getaway trip.
During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called
Kumejima (久米島町), located just a 30-minute flight - or a 4-hour boat ride
from the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but it was the best decision
we made on this whole trip!

So we arrived to Kumejima very early in about 11 am and we had some time till
our hotel check-in - we really didn't know what to expect. We brought our
snorkeling masks from home and hope for the best!

Acording to the internet there are only 2 bus lines on the island, We so only 1
and he is not very frequent (once every 2 hours). but we also saw 2 taxis there
waiting to pick people from the airport. Hahahah

When we arrived we tought maybe we should try to hitchhike, i have some
experience [doing it](/travel/404) and my girlfriend really wanted to try.

And let me tell you! This was great success! In our 30 hours there we hitchhiked
with 6 different people

We went to many different beaches there and try to snorkel arround, we went in a
bit of a windy wethear so the water was not as clean but we still managed to see
many different kinds of fish

#### Where we stayed

- We stayed in: **Bears Stay Kumejima Eef Beach**
  - Very close to the Family Mart + Local resturant & bar
  - The rooms where very big
  - No reception. all the check-in happend in front of a machine, so you cannot
    check in early
  - The cleaning lady was very nice and she gave us extra towels for the beach!
