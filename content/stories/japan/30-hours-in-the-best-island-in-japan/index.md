Me and my girlfriend spent about 4 days in Okinawa as a quick getaway trip.
During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called
Kumejima (久米島町), located just a 30-minute flight - or a 4-hour boat ride
from the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but it was the best decision
we made on this whole trip!

So we arrived to Kumejima very early in about 11 am and we had some time till
our hotel check-in - we really didn't know what to expect. We brought our
snorkeling masks from home and hope for the best!

Acording to the internet there are only 2 bus lines on the island, We so only 1
and he is not very frequent (once every 2 hours). but we also saw 2 taxis there
waiting to pick people from the airport. Hahahah

When we arrived we tought maybe we should try to hitchhike, i have some
experience [doing it](/travel/404) and my girlfriend really wanted to try.

And let me tell you! This was great success! In our 30 hours there we hitchhiked
with 6 different people

We went to many different beaches there and try to snorkel arround, we went in a
bit of a windy wethear so the water was not as clean but we still managed to see
many different kinds of fish

### Snorkeling in Paradise

We only had 30 hours on this island, so we ended up going to just 3–4 beaches!

The first beach we went to was
[Eef Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W2KQ57fLT64S15JSA). This place seriously
looked like paradise — 50 shades of blue in the water, pretty clean visibility,
and an amazing view all the way to the horizon. It was only a 2-minute walk from
our hotel, so it made the perfect first stop before we could check in.

We literally hid our bags and changed into swimsuits in the middle of the road.

The beach itself was great. There’s even a Family Mart within walking distance,
so we grabbed some snacks and beers. We tried snorkeling there, but because it
was a windy day, the water near the shore got pretty sandy — not the greatest
experience. After talking to some locals, we realized this is actually one of
the _least recommended_ places to snorkel in Kume...

We still saw a bunch of fish, but it was nothing compared to what came next.

Since check-in time still hadn't arrived, I was like, "Let's just walk a bit and
maybe hitchhike our way to the east side of the island." There are two tiny
islands connected to the main one by a bridge, and I thought they might be a
cool place to snorkel.

Little did I know we'd end up hitchhiking with this super friendly and kind
local named **Kairi** (you’ll hear more about him later). He picked us up,
showed us around a bit, and then drove us all the way to this spot at the edge
of the [second island](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xwuaPjyTaL3FW3v37). He told us
this was the perfect time to see sea turtles.

We were so excited. Even though low tide was starting to kick in, we grabbed our
gear and ran straight into the water.

The water was super shallow - maybe 1 meter deep at most. We saw three white
murenas swimming around, switching their little "camping spots" and hunting
small fish. Then, just as the sun hit the water at the right angle, we started
spotting them - sea turtles! So many of them, just casually swimming in the
shallow water, munching on sea grass.

We spent the next two hours walking around in the water, trying to get close to
the turtles without scaring them off. But every time they noticed us, they
zoomed away - I had no idea turtles could swim that fast.

After that, we were completely dead. We hitchhiked back with a Japanese guy who
didn't know a single word of English, but he somehow dropped us off exactly at
our hotel. Called it a day.

#### Where we stayed

- We stayed in: **Bears Stay Kumejima Eef Beach**
  - Very close to the Family Mart + Local resturant & bar
  - The rooms where very big
  - No reception. all the check-in happend in front of a machine, so you cannot
    check in early
  - The cleaning lady was very nice and she gave us extra towels for the beach!
