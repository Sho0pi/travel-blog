+++

Let me tell you the crazy story of the first time i tried to hitch hike in rural
Thailand. I had couple of days before my live aboard scuba diving experience,
and decide to hitch hike to a town located 3 hours from me. little that i know i
will spend the next 7 hours with a drunk driver driving all the way to the
border of Malasya to an area that is forbidden to israelis to go to.

### The plan

My plan was simple, I heard there is a nice town call Trang in the south of
thailand, that was not too far from where i were in that time - Krabi, i thought
it will be nice to spend a few days there. I decided to try and hitch hike with
a sign that just says "South" is thai, I practce on like 3 different cardboards
before i actually manage to write it down in a way it will look close to the
thai writing hahaha.

I went taehutahuthaetuh thautha thatuh ath thuath tthis is really nice i realy
like tit and this is very cool
